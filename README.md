**FRONT-END API INTEGRATION**
---

- Our site uses HTTPOnly cookies to enhance security. These cookies are not accessible via JavaScript, which reduces the risk of attacks like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting). Instead, we use cross-authentication mechanisms to handle secure communication between the front end and back end. This ensures sensitive data is protected while maintaining seamless integration for the user.
